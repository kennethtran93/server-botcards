Bot Cards Exchange
##################

This webapp is an "engine" for managing the trading of "bot cards",
the excuse for ACIT4850 assignments in the Winter 2016 term..

*****************
Programming Style
*****************

Some of the programming design decisions reflected:

-   The architecture adheres more to the "model-view-adapter" convention,
    where the view is unaware of the source of data and the model is unaware of
    how any data might be presented. The controllers are go-betweens.
-   Views are templated - an overall one for page layout, and then
    individual templates for the panels that are assembled to make up a page.
-   View fragments are used to style single "records" on their own,
    improving cohesion.
-   A base controller takes care of assembling finished pages, using the 
    master template.
-   A base model takes care of CRUD functionality.
-   The CodeIgniter framework folder has been moved outside of the webapp,
    in this case to a "system3" folder at the same hierarchy level as the 
    document root.
-   An ".htaccess" file is incorporated, to configure Apache to remove
    index.php from any URLs.

Using the engine
****************

The ACIT4850 students have been tasked with building bot card trader webapps,
which will broker the purchase and sale of bot trading cards for their
users.

This webapp provides backend support for those trader webapps, and should
prove particularly useful for testing :-/
