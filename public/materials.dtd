Reference page. -->
<!ELEMENT group (item)*>
<!ATTLIST group

<!--- Each item is a specific kind of content found in this course.
The group's "type" is used for generating a URL to trigger the
appropriate presentation for that kind of content. 
Note: A framework course might be long on tutorials and examples, while
an academic course might be long on labs and assignments.
Exams and/or quizzes are sorta provided for, though the handling is vague.
